# Initiative LED Plugin for Foundry VTT

This Foundry VTT plugin, allows you to control LED's connected to an ESP8266 / ESP32 using the [WLED Firmware](https://kno.wled.ge/).

With this plugin you can assign LEDs to the seats of your teammates. The LED's can be integrated into your tabletop gaming experience to provide a visual representation of initiative order.

## Hardware
I used an SK6812 stripe with six LED's and a ESP32 controller.

Of course you can use all LEDs and controllers (supported by WLED).
The WLED page explains the exact hardware installation better than I could here, which is why I refer you to their [quick start](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/getting-started/).

Once you have the hardware ready, all you need is the IP address of the WLED controller and you can continue.
